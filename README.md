# Distributed and Parallel Systems Final Exam - Performance Analysis

This repository contains the complete analysis and results of the final exam project for the **Distributed and Parallel Systems** course. The project focuses on measuring and comparing the performance of **sequential**, **multithreaded**, and **multiprocessing** approaches to sorting and filtering operations on a real-world dataset.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore how different parallel processing techniques affect the execution time and efficiency of common data operations. We use a taxi trip duration dataset and perform:

- **Sorting** of trip durations
- **Filtering** of trip durations above a given threshold

The dataset is sampled into four fractions (25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) to observe how the data size influences performance.
